### Schema

Table creation code is in `schema.sql`

Code to drop every table is in `drop_all.sql`

### Server

Use script `update_sql.sh` to deploy changes to schema. 

Note: The script drops every table and recreates them.

Use `login` to open psql terminal 

(Or just use the `grp_psql.sh` script, login is just an alias, this is just so you don't need to enter the password)


### Todo

Would be helpful to have a script to add dummy data. Add that to update_sql.
